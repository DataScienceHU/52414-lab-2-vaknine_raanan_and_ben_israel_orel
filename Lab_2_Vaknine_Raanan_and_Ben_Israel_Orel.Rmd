### Q0.Submission Instructions  
  
This lab will be submitted in pairs using GitHub (if you don't have a pair, please contact us).  
Please follow the steps in the  [GitHub-Classroom Lab 2](https://classroom.github.com/g/6_Wy5z44) to create your group's Lab 2 repository.  
**Important: your team's name must be `FamilyName1_Name1_and_FamilyName2_Name2`**.  
You can collaborate with your partner using the git environment; You can either make commits straight to master, or create individual branches (recommended). However, once done, be sure to merge your branches to master - you will be graded using the most recent *master* version - your last push and merge before the deadline.   
**Please do not open/review other peoples' repositories - we will be notified by GitHub if you do.**

Your final push should include this Rmd file (with your answers) together with the html file that is outputted automatically by knitr when you knit the Rmd. Anything else will be disregarded. In addition, please adhere to the following file format:    
`Lab_2_FamilyName1_Name1_and_FamilyName2_Name2.Rmd/html`      

Some questions may require data wrangling and manipulation which you need to decide on. <br>
In some graphs you may need to change the graph limits. If you do so, please include the outlier 
points you have removed in a separate table.

Show numbers in plots/tables using standard digits and not scientific display. That is: 90000000 and not 9e+06. <br>
Round numbers to at most 3 digits after the dot - that is, 9.456 and not 9.45581451044


The required libraries are listed below the instructions. You are allowed to add additional libraries if you want. 
If you do so, *please explain what libraries you've added, and what is each new library used for*. 

#### Background: 

You've been hired as a data analyst at the football (soccer) club Hapoel London. 
Since this is a small and under-funded club, you will not have access to real-football data, but to data from 
the football computer game fifa18. Your job is to analyze this dataset and extract meaningful insights from the data in order 
to help your club make better decisions. 

#### Data File: 
You will load and analyze the fifa18 football dataset file called "fifa_data.csv". <br> 
The dataset contains detailed information about each player in the game, including: names, age, nationality, overall ability, estimated potential ability, current club and league, market value, salary (wage), ability at different football skills (also called 'attributes', e.g. Ball.control, Sprint.speed ...), ability to play at different position in the game (CF, CM, ...) and the preferred positions of the player. 



Required Libraries:
```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(corrplot)
library(scales)   # needed for formatting y-axis labels to non-scientific type
library(radarchart)
library(tidyr)
library(tidyverse)
library(reshape2) # melt
library(ggthemes)
library(rworldmap) # world map
library(modelr)

library(grid)
library(ggrepel)


options("scipen"=100, "digits"=4)  # avoid scientific display of digits. Take 4 digits. 
```

<br/><br/>

## Q1. Basic Statistics (25 pt)         

First, you are requested to load the fifa18 dataset and find and display general information about the players. 

a. Make a plot showing the age distribution of all players.
b. Make a plot comparing the *overall* ability of players in different leagues ('League'). Describe which leagues have especially good/bad players.
c. Make a plot showing the density of players' salary ('Wage') distribution. <br>
Next, make a separate plot showing the density distribution of the *log* of players' salary. <br>
Which of the two visualizations is better? how skewed are the distributions? do they have fat tails? which is better described by a Normal distribution? explain. 
d. Are the top-10 players with the highest value also the top-10 best players in terms of *overall* ability? 
Show tables for both and compare. <br> Who is the best player not in the top-10 valued players? 
e. Show a table of the ten *best* and ten *worst* teams in terms of *average* player overall ability. 


Loading the data + Q1 Answers:
a. Make a plot showing the age distribution of all players.
```{r}
fifa_players <- data.frame(read.csv(url("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DataScienceHU/DataAnalysisR_2020/master/data/fifa_data.csv")))
# Pre-processing: 
for (i in c(3,6,7,10:71)) {
  fifa_players[,i]<-as.numeric((fifa_players[,i]))
}
fifa<-na.omit(fifa_players)
fifa_players<-fifa
fifa_players_info<-fifa[,c(1:11)] # players general info 
fifa_players_attribures<-fifa[,c(1,12:45, 6)] # players different skills. Add overall
fifa_players_positions<-fifa[,c(1,46:72,6)] # players ability at different positions . Add overall 

#a - Age Distribution

ggplot(data = fifa_players,aes(x=Age))+geom_bar()+xlab("Age")+ylab("# of Players")
```
The highest distribution is within age 25 and it drops immidiately afterwords. There are several players in the late 40s with is surprising.


b. Make a plot comparing the *overall* ability of players in different leagues ('League'). Describe which leagues have especially good/bad players.
```{r}
#b

ggplot(data = fifa_players,aes(x=League,y = Overall))+geom_boxplot()+coord_flip()
```
Spain, Portugal Premier League and serie A have especially good players. Both Switzerland and Scotland leagues have especially bad players.


c. Make a plot showing the density of players' salary ('Wage') distribution. <br>
Next, make a separate plot showing the density distribution of the *log* of players' salary. <br>
Which of the two visualizations is better? how skewed are the distributions? do they have fat tails? which is better described by a Normal distribution? explain. 
```{r}
#c

d<-density(fifa_players$Wage)
plot(d, xlab="Wage")

#log of the salaries

d2<-density(log(fifa_players$Wage))
plot(d2, xlab="Wage's Log")

#Skeweness&Fat Tails
wage <- fifa_players %>% select(Wage) %>% subset(Wage>0) # wage with no zeros, otherwise log wont be defined
wage<-wage$Wage
skewness(wage)
skewness(log(wage))
kurtosis(wage)
kurtosis(log(wage))

# plotting a qqplot to see which one looks more normal.

qqnorm(wage)
qqnorm(log(wage))
```
the slaries density plot gets really high really soon but then drops dramatically. Wage's Log- as we can see, a lot of the players are around the value 4 and 6-7 and just a little part of the players have a wage log of over 12. The log vizualization is much better and clearer and you can see everything better. The regular wage is a lot more skewed because it is more densed. For the same reason, the regular wage density has a fatter tails. As we can see in the qqplots, the log plot looks a lot more like a normal distribution.



d. Are the top-10 players with the highest value also the top-10 best players in terms of *overall* ability? 
Show tables for both and compare. <br> Who is the best player not in the top-10 valued players? 
```{r}
#d

top_10_players_by_overall<-fifa_players %>% select(Name, Overall) %>% top_n(Overall, n=10)

# top ten players by overall
arrange(top_10_players_by_overall,desc(Overall))

top_10_players_by_wage<-fifa_players %>% select(Name, Wage) %>% top_n(Wage, n=10)

# top 10 players by wage
arrange(top_10_players_by_wage,desc(Wage))
```
No the players that have the highest value but are not in the top 10 in terms of overall ability are: G.Bale, L.Modric, S.Aguero, Sergio Ramos. The best player not in the top-10 valued players are both M.Neuer and Neymar with an Overall of 92.



e. Show a table of the ten *best* and ten *worst* teams in terms of *average* player overall ability. 
```{r}
#e

teams_avg_ability<-fifa_players %>% select(Club, Overall) %>% group_by(Club) %>% summarise(Overall=mean(Overall))

#ten best
head(arrange(teams_avg_ability,desc(Overall)),10)

# ten worst
head(arrange(teams_avg_ability,Overall),10)

```

## Q2. Scouting Report (25 pt)

You are in charge of the scouting division. The goal of this division is to follow players' potential and overall ability, and identify undervalued players - that is, players whose current value is lower compared to what would be expected based on their predicted future ability. 

a. Your boss wants to fly abroad to recruit promising players. Use the *rworldmap* package to display the world map and color each country based on the *total number of players* from this nationality. 

b. Quantity may not guarantee quality. Repeat the above analysis but this time display a world map where each country is colored by the *average overall quality* of players. Find an under-represented country you'd recommend to travel to (i.e. a country with few players with high overall average quality). 

c. Show the *average overall* ability by *age* of all players, for players 35 years old or younger

d. Make a graph showing the *average difference* between a player's overall ability to potential ability as a function of age, up to age 35. At what ages should we expect to find players for future development based on this graph?  

e. We are seeking young (age <=21) players with high Overall ability (>85). Show a scatter plot of these players comparing their *Potential* ability (y-axis) and current salary (*Wage*, x-axis). 
Prepare a table showing the 10 most-undervalued players, i.e. currently lowest payed compared to their potential. Calculate for each of them what is a fair salary matching their potential that you would offer to lure them away from their current club and show it in the table.

Q2 answers:

 Your boss wants to fly abroad to recruit promising players. Use the *rworldmap* package to display the world map and color each country based on the *total number of players* from this nationality. 
```{r}

#a

countries_and_count<-fifa_players %>% select(Nationality, Name) %>% group_by(Nationality) %>% summarise(num_of_players=n_distinct(Name))

countries_and_count <- joinCountryData2Map(dF = countries_and_count, joinCode = "NAME", nameJoinColumn = "Nationality",verbose=FALSE)

mapCountryData(mapToPlot = countries_and_count, nameColumnToPlot = "num_of_players"
               ,catMethod = "fixedWidth",colourPalette = c("light yellow","yellow","light green","green"
                , "dark green","brown") ,oceanCol = "steelblue1", missingCountryCol = "gray",
               mapTitle = "Players in each country", aspect = "variable")
```


Quantity may not guarantee quality. Repeat the above analysis but this time display a world map where each country is colored by the *average overall quality* of players. Find an under-represented country you'd recommend to travel to (i.e. a country with few players with high overall average quality). 
```{r}
#b

countries_and_means<-fifa_players %>% select(Nationality, Overall) %>% group_by(Nationality) %>% summarise(mean_overall=mean(Overall))

countries_and_means <- joinCountryData2Map(dF = countries_and_means, joinCode = "NAME", nameJoinColumn = "Nationality",verbose=FALSE)

mapCountryData(mapToPlot = countries_and_means, nameColumnToPlot = "mean_overall"
               ,catMethod = "fixedWidth",colourPalette = c("light yellow","yellow","light green","green"
                , "dark green","brown") ,oceanCol = "steelblue1", missingCountryCol = "gray",
               mapTitle = "Players in each country by Average Overall", aspect = "variable")
```
Solution: Algeria and Egypt are under represented countries because they doesnt have a lot of players but their overall rate is relatively high


Show the *average overall* ability by *age* of all players, for players 35 years old or younger
```{r}

#c

age_and_means<-fifa_players %>% subset(Age<=35) %>% select(Age, Overall) %>% group_by(Age) %>% summarise(mean_overall=mean(Overall))

ggplot(data = age_and_means,aes(x=Age, y=mean_overall))+geom_line()+xlab("Age")+ylab("AVG Overall")
```


Make a graph showing the *average difference* between a player's overall ability to potential ability as a function of age, up to age 35. At what ages should we expect to find players for future development based on this graph?  
```{r}
#d

my_df <- fifa_players %>% subset(Age<=35) %>% select(Age,Overall,Potential)
diff <- my_df$Potential-my_df$Overall
my_df <- cbind(my_df, diff)
my_df<- my_df %>% group_by(Age) %>% summarise(mean_diff=mean(diff))
ggplot(data = my_df,aes(x=Age, y=mean_diff))+geom_line()+xlab("Age")+ylab("AVG Difference")
```
Solution: As we can see in the graph we can expect to find players for future development under the age of 20 and specifically players at age 16 have the highest difference


We are seeking young (age <=21) players with high Overall ability (>85). Show a scatter plot of these players comparing their *Potential* ability (y-axis) and current salary (*Wage*, x-axis). 
Prepare a table showing the 10 most-undervalued players, i.e. currently lowest payed compared to their potential. Calculate for each of them what is a fair salary matching their potential that you would offer to lure them away from their current club and show it in the table.
```{r}
#e

under_21 <- fifa_players %>% subset(Age<=21) %>% subset(Potential>85) %>% select(Name, Potential, Wage)
ggplot(data = under_21,aes(x=Wage, y=Potential))+geom_point()+xlab("Wage")+ylab("Potential") + geom_smooth(method=lm)


avg_wage_per_potential <- fifa_players %>% subset(Potential>85) %>% select(Potential, Wage) %>% 
  group_by(Potential) %>%  summarise(fair_salary=mean(Wage))
#calculating the average Wage for players with Potential over 85

players_under_21_with_potential_wage <- under_21 %>% inner_join(avg_wage_per_potential, by=c("Potential"="Potential"))
#creating a table that for each young player shows his potential, and the average wages of players with the same Potential

diff<-players_under_21_with_potential_wage$fair_salary-players_under_21_with_potential_wage$Wage
#calculating the differance between wage he should get and the wage he actually gets

players_under_21_with_potential_wage<-cbind(players_under_21_with_potential_wage, diff)

players_under_21_with_potential_wage<-unique.data.frame(players_under_21_with_potential_wage)

#needs better wage:
arrange(players_under_21_with_potential_wage,desc(diff)) %>% head(10)

#arranging the data by the biggest differences and selecting only the top ten under 21 players with the biggest difference, and their #fair salary which is based on the average wage per overall ability
```

## Q3. Model Building (30 pt)
In this question we try to find specific skills which can *predict* the overall players' quality. 
We will also build graphs which will help us compare different skills.

a. We are interested in finding out which skills are similar in terms of players' performance at the position. 
Extract the 29 skills for non-goalkeeper players (Acceleration, ..., Volleys, except 'GK.*' skills). 
Calculate the correlation between players' ability in each pair of skills and show a heatmap correlation-plot of the correlations' matrix. What two skills seem least correlated with other skills? 
b. Consider the following six major players positions: CAM, CB, CM, RB, RW, ST and in addition the Overall players' performance. Show a correlation-plot of players' skill levels vs. their performance at the six positions + Overall performance. Find the 7 skills mostly correlated for player's Overall performance and list them in a table.
c. Build your team by selecting six *different* players, one in each of the above positions in such a way that the players chosen are the best in their individual position. If the same player is the best at multiple positions, try to build the team in such a way that maximize the team's overall average score. Using the function `radarchart::chartJSRadar`,graph their abilities (individually for all 6 player) in a spider (radarchart) graph. See below an example for such a chart. What is your team's overall average score?
[radar chart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radar_chart) (also called 'spider chart')  
d. We are interested in determining how each of the different player's abilities changes with age. 
Repeat the analysis of question 2.c., but this time show the different skills separately. 
Which skills peak at youngest/oldest ages?
e. Your boss suggests that some players may be currently under-performing compared to their skill levels (possibly due to poor fit with their current Club, recent injuries, bad luck, psychological or other reasons), 
and that acquiring them may be beneficial as they will be expected to perform better in the future. 
Fit a multiple regression model predicting player's Overall performance based on their skill level at the 29 different skills. Find the $10$ players with the least Overall performance level compared to what would their set of skills predict, 
and list them in a table.

                                             Crossing, Curve, Dribbling, Finishing
                                             ,Free.kick.accuracy, Heading.accuracy
                                             ,Interceptions, Jumping, Long.passing
                                             ,Long.shots,Marking, Penalties, Positioning

relevant_attributes_cor<-cor(relevant_attributes)
corrplot(relevant_attributes_cor)
  
```
Solution: Both Jumping and Strength seemed to have less correlation with other skills.


b. Consider the following six major players positions: CAM, CB, CM, RB, RW, ST and in addition the Overall players' performance. Show a correlation-plot of players' skill levels vs. their performance at the six positions + Overall performance. Find the 7 skills mostly correlated for player's Overall performance and list them in a table.
```{r}
relevant_positions<-fifa_players %>% select(Overall, CAM, CB, CM, RB, RW, ST)
cor_pos_attr<-cor(relevant_attributes,relevant_positions)
corrplot(cor_pos_attr)
cor_pos_attr_df<- as.data.frame(cor(relevant_attributes,relevant_positions))
cor_pos_attr_df <- arrange(cor_pos_attr_df,desc(Overall)) %>% top_n(Overall, n=7)
# top 7 skills that are most strongly correlated with Overall

Solution: The skills that peak youngest: Sprint speed, acceleration, Agility. The skills that peak older: Agression, Composure, Overall, Interception, Strength, Jumping, Vision.

e. Your boss suggests that some players may be currently under-performing compared to their skill levels (possibly due to poor fit with their current Club, recent injuries, bad luck, psychological or other reasons), 
and that acquiring them may be beneficial as they will be expected to perform better in the future. 
Fit a multiple regression model predicting player's Overall performance based on their skill level at the 29 different skills. Find the $10$ players with the least Overall performance level compared to what would their set of skills predict, 
and list them in a table. 

```{r}
model_attributes<- fifa_players_attribures[1:length(fifa_players_attribures)-1]
model_overall<-fifa_players_attribures$Overall
my_model<-lm(model_overall~.,data<-model_attributes)

Prediction<-predict(my_model,model_attributes)

fifa_players$Prediction<-Prediction

Residuals<-resid(my_model)

fifa_players$Residuals<-Residuals

#most underrated players
arrange(fifa_players, Residuals) %>% select(ID, Name, Age, Overall, League, Prediction, Residuals) %>% head(10)

```


## Q4. Fix Problematic Plots (10 pt)

The previous data-analyst of the club was fired for producing poor plots. 
Below see a code for two bar plots that he made.

a. Describe in your own words what did your predecessor try to show in each of the two plots. 
b. Find *at least* three problematic issues with his plot, and explain them. 
c. Fix the problematic issues above in the code below to generate new, improved plots. 
You will get an additional *bonus* point for finding any additional problem and fixing it.  



```{r}
# A measure of category's diversity
DIV <- function(category_vec){
  t <- table(category_vec)
  p <- t/sum(t)
  return(sum(p^2))
}

cleaned_data <- fifa_players %>% select(Nationality,Club) %>% na.omit()

number_of_nationality_in_club <- cleaned_data %>% group_by(Club,Nationality) %>% summarise(count = n()) %>% group_by(Club) %>% summarise(N_nation=n()) %>% arrange(desc(N_nation)) %>% mutate(Club = factor(Club,level=unique(Club)))

DIV_in_club <- cleaned_data %>% group_by(Club) %>% summarise(DIV = DIV(Nationality))%>% arrange(DIV)%>% mutate(Club = factor(Club,level=unique(Club)))  # arrange(desc(DIV)) %>% 

# Plot number of different nationalities in each club
g <- ggplot(data = number_of_nationality_in_club %>% head(10),aes(x = Club,y = N_nation,color = Club))
g + geom_bar(stat="identity")

# Plot DIV (diversity?) of different nationalities in each club
g <- ggplot(data = DIV_in_club %>% head(10),aes(x = Club,y = DIV, color = Club))
g <- g + geom_bar(stat="identity")
g
```

a. Describe in your own words what did your predecessor try to show in each of the two plots. 

SOLUTION:  In the first plot he tried to show the number of nations in each club (only the top ten clubs with most nationalities) i.e how many different nations clubs have, Then he selected only the top 10 clubs with most different nations. 
In the second plot, He tried to show the diversity in the top 10 most diversed clubs but in a different way. In the second plot he decided to take into consideration the size of the club (a biggest club is more likely to have more nations) and then he devided the number of nationalities by the size of the club using the DIV function in order to get a less biased result of which are the top 10 most diversed clubs. Then he plotted the clubs with their diversity rates.

b. Find *at least* three problematic issues with his plot, and explain them. 

SOLUTION: 
First Problem- All the bars in the plots have the same color (with different borders) which looks a bit misleading.
Second problem: The clubs name should be aligned vertically instead of horizontally for better readability.
Third Problem: Both plots contain a bar plot without a label, since it is probably players with no club, I would remove it since it's irrelevant for our visualization.
Fourth problem: The Y axis doesn't have a very informative name in both plots.

c. Fix the problematic issues above in the code below to generate new, improved plots. 
```{r}
g <- ggplot(data = number_of_nationality_in_club %>% subset(Club != "")  %>% head(10),aes(x = Club,y = N_nation, fill = Club)) + ylab("Number of Nationalities in Club") + theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle=90,hjust=0.95,vjust=0.2))
g + geom_bar(stat="identity")

g <- ggplot(data = DIV_in_club %>% subset(Club != "") %>% head(10),aes(x = Club,y = DIV, fill = Club)) + ylab("Diversity in Club") + 
  theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle=90,hjust=0.95,vjust=0.2))
g <- g + geom_bar(stat="identity")
g

```

## Q5. Back to the real world (10 pt)

Your boss is not convinced that your analysis of the fifa18 dataset is relevant for performance in the real world. To convince her, you need to show her that the fifa18 data can predict actual performance in football. Load the fifa ranking dataset ['fifa_ranking.csv'](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DataScienceHU/DataAnalysisR_2020/master/data/fifa_ranking.csv) which contains ranking of countries based on their actual performance in international football competitions. 
Use the fifa18 dataset to compare the real vs. game football levels across all countries. 
What is your conclusion regarding the relevancy of the fifa18 game dataset to the real world?
Use your best judgment to choose the appropriate data, models, analysis and plots to support your conclusions. 

```{r}
ranking<-data.frame(read.csv(url("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DataScienceHU/DataAnalysisR_2020/master/data/fifa_ranking.csv")))

df_by_skills_pred<-fifa_players %>% select(Nationality, Prediction) %>% arrange(desc(Prediction))
all_nationalities<-unique(fifa_players$Nationality)

Nationality<-c()
nations_avg_pred<-c()
for(nation in all_nationalities){
  Nationality<-c(Nationality, nation)
  nation_df<- df_by_skills_pred %>% subset(Nationality==nation) %>% head(11) %>% group_by(Nationality) %>% 
      summarise(avg_pred=mean(Prediction))
  nations_avg_pred<-c(nations_avg_pred,nation_df$avg_pred)
}

nations_prediction_df<-data.frame(Nationality,nations_avg_pred) %>% arrange(desc(nations_avg_pred))

updated_rank<-ranking %>% subset(rank_date=="1994-02-15") # taking only the most updated rank

df_with_avg_prediction_and_rank<- fifa_players %>% merge(nations_prediction_df, by="Nationality") %>% 
  merge(updated_rank, by.x = "Nationality", by.y = "country_full") %>% select(Nationality, rank, nations_avg_pred)

# Two tables showing that most of the top ranked countries also have the top average prediction

distinct(df_with_avg_prediction_and_rank) %>% arrange(rank)
distinct(df_with_avg_prediction_and_rank) %>% arrange(desc(nations_avg_pred))

#calculating correlation

df_for_corr_plot<-distinct(df_with_avg_prediction_and_rank) %>% arrange(desc(nations_avg_pred))
pred_rank_corr<-cor(df_for_corr_plot$rank,df_for_corr_plot$nations_avg_pred)

#creating a plot showing the relationship

ggplot(df_for_corr_plot, aes(x=rank, y=nations_avg_pred)) + geom_point() + xlab("Country's Rank") + ylab("Country's AVG Prediction") +
labs(title="Relationship Between a Country's Rank and AVG Prediction") + geom_smooth(method=lm)

```
PLEASE ADD YOUR SOLUTION BELOW, WITH A CLEAR SEPARATION BETWEEN THE PARTS! 

SOLUTION: I created a calculation of the average overall *prediction* of each country's top 11 players (i.e the national team) with the prediction we added in Q3.
thus, we can see which countries really have players with higher skills and are actually better skill-wise. Then I do a join with the original fifa_players data frame 
, to show the average prediction for each country and I also join the rank from the ranks data frame to show it side-by-side. First, I show two tables, the first being top 
ranked countries with their average prediction and the second being the top countries by average prediction with their rank. This shows that among the ten top countries by average prediction, 6 of them are ranked in the top 10 (Spain, Germany, Brazil, Argentina, Netherlands, Italy) and England is ranked in the 12th place and France in the 14th.
Later, I calculate the correlation between the nation's average prediction and their rank and show that there is actually a high correlation between the two: -0.69 which means 
that the higher their average prediction is. the lower their rank is. Then I create a scatter plot of Rank vs. AVG Prediction with a regression line
